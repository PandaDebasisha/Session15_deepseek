 Chapter 16: Music Festivals Across America

Have you ever heard of a music festival before? A music festival is a huge event where people gather together to enjoy live music performances by their favorite artists! These events often take place outside, in large parks or fields, and last for several days. People come from far and wide to attend these special concerts, sometimes camping out overnight to secure a good spot.

Music festivals feature different types of music, including rock, pop, hip hop, country, electronic dance music, and more. Some festivals focus on just one type of music, while others showcase a variety of sounds
